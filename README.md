PROBLEM STATEMENT
Apply Basic PCA on the iris dataset.
• Describe the data set. Should the dataset been standardized?

• Describe the structure of correlations among variables.

• Compute a PCA with the maximum number of components.

• Compute the cumulative explained variance ratio. Determine the number of components𝐾 by your computed values.

• Print the𝐾principal components directions and correlations of the 𝐾principal compo-nents with the original variables. Interpret the contribution of the original variables into the PC.

• Plot the samples projected into the𝐾first PCs.

• Color samples by their species.
